Divvy Up (Mobile Application)

Samford University, Spring 2016

For my undergraduate senior project, I worked on a mobile social coding application for Android devices. 
This solution sought to bring collaborative code editing to mobile devices.

This project initially began as a team project from the previous semester (Fall 2015) in a software engineering class.
