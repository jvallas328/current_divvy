*** When you make a change in android studio like delete or add a file, you need
    to sync your changes to GitHub

1. save your project in android studio by clicking the save icon

2. (Re)open GitHub Desktop

3. Select the current project on the left

3. Click the open circle on the very right end of the branch timeline

4. You should see a list of your changes now. You must type a summary and description 
of your change in order to commit any changes. Please do this step descriptively 
because it helps the rest of us know what is different.

5. Click commit changes

6. click the sync button in GitHub Desktop


------------------------------------------


*** When wanting to pull an update(s) from GitHub to your project

1. (Re)open Github Desktop

2. Select the current project on the left

3. select the dot on the branch timeline with the updates you wish to sync to 
(most likely the very last dot on the timeline, right beside the open circle)
--> now click the sync button in GitHub Desktop

4. Reopen the android studio project


------------------------------------------


*** If you cannot successfully pull new updates and you want to "reset", do the following:

1. Go to Github Desktop. Right Click the current project on the left and select remove.

2. Go to your local GitHub folder in file explorer. Delete the current android studio
project directory so that your local GithHub directory is now empty

3. Go back to Github Desktop, click the "+" icon (top left), select "clone" from the
tabs shown on the screen, select the current project, and put it into the empty 
local Github directory

4. (Re)open android studio, close any current projects, open the project in the local
GitHub directory

- Enjoy
